*T-Series coming up first?
*Fortnite?
*The fact that I don't know 95% of these people
*Davie504 isn't included in the music videos?
*No Phil Swift? That's taken care of
No memes
MrBeast Enes Batur
*A YouTube Rewind
*Not even Keanu Reeves?
*Fortnite didn't get 69B likes?
*So where's the Pewdiepie T-series battle again?
*Not even any of those other people who worked so hard and are even in the top 10 most subscribed like Jacksepticeye and Markiplier?
*Where's Watchmojo in a Top 10 Video?
*Atleast give credit to Notch if you're Including Minecraft, you did credit Will Smith for Fortnite
*So since where doing Twitch, where's Tyler1?
*An UNsatisfying slime scene
